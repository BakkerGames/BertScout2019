# BertScout2019

This is the FIRST Robotics FRC event scouting app for the 2019 season. It is
being written by BERT 133 (Bonny Eagle Robotics Team) in Standish, Maine, USA.

Scouting is done during matches to aid in alliance selection for the finals.
The top eight teams from qualification matches each pick two other teams to
join them in the finals. This app tracks how all the teams did during their
qualification matches. Six teams compete at a time, three on each side, and
six Kindle Fires are used to enter the data from one robot per match.

The app this year is being written in C# using Xamarin.Forms, so it can be
used from Kindle Fire tablets (Android) as well as Windows 10 computers (UWP).
It includes the project for running it on iOS, but that may be beyond
the scope for this year.

All data will be stored locally on each device, and transmitted to an
external website server for consolidation. The combined results will be
available on the website, or can be downloaded back to each Kindle Fire or
Windows 10 computer.

During the 2019 Build Season, this app will be changing quite a bit, with
more features added all the time.
